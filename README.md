The Economist magazine weekly pdf download.

# Why this repository?
I'm looking for The Economist magazine weekly pdf over the Internet, but I only found very few sites that provide a free download of the original weekly edition. Worse, the download sites have annoying ads and download limits. So I create this repository and upload downloaded pdf for ones need it, while hoping there're more helpers to download these pdf from the Internet and share with others.

# How to help?
Download the newspaper from the websites mentioned above or somewhere else you know and make a PR.
Prefer an Asia Edition.

# What's the AD FREE edition?
The newspaper contains a few pages of advertisement, which results in an unhappy reading experience. So I decided to splite the pdf and merge it again to remove these unwelcomed pages. Every ad-removed pdf begins with 'AD FREE'.
